# Characterization of sEMG signals and classification-powered prostheses control.
### by: A. Quintana Criado

## 4th September 2024
The project is now over into another repo. I had to fully restart everything back in June 24. See: https://github.com/Quintanaaalberto/GraspNet-MEng

## 19th February 2024. 
The project has been restarted completely. The new goal of the project is to train a Deep Learning model to classify the sEMG signals in the Dataset called Ninapro DB10 from the Harvard database.  -> https://ninapro.hevs.ch/instructions/DB10.html  There are two approaches in mind right now:
* 1st approach: CNN model to classify 12 channels of sEMG as a timeseries (signal)
* 2nd approach: CNN model to classify the sEMG as images
